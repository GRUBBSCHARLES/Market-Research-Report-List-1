<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical neonatal ventilators market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require the insertion of an endotracheal tube to deliver oxygen directly into the lungs, suitable for critically ill neonates needing intensive respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, utilize face masks or nasal prongs to assist breathing without invasive procedures, making them ideal for less severe cases or during weaning. Both types are essential for ensuring proper respiratory function in vulnerable infants.</p></p>
