<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Grates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scroll Type</li><li>Reciprocating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical grates market comprises primarily two types: scroll type and reciprocating type. Scroll type grates utilize a spiral motion to efficiently separate solids from liquids, making them ideal for continuous operations. In contrast, reciprocating type grates operate with a back-and-forth motion, allowing for effective removal of heavier solids, often used in batch processing. Both types are critical in waste management and industrial applications, enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring effective solid-liquid separation.</p></p>
